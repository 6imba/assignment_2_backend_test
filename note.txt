- If you need to create a your own restful api, we have a CRUD operation and for that crud operation we have a equivalent http verb/method.

# http verb/method:
    - create ==> post http_method
    - read ==> get http_method
    - update ==> put/patch http_method
    - delete ==> delete http_method

# end-point/route:
    - post ==> api/users
    - get ==> api/users
    - patch/put ==> api/users
    - delete ==> api/users
